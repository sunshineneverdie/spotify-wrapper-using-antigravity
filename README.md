## 🚀 Key Features

- **Native Media Key Support**: Full integration with your keyboard's Play/Pause, Next, and Previous keys (works even in the background).
- **YouTube Playback Fallback**: Automatically tracks the current song and provides a one-click button to play it on YouTube if Spotify playback is restricted.
- **Modern Dark-Mode Login**: Hardened Google Login flow that forces the modern dark-mode account chooser and bypasses "Insecure Browser" blocks.
- **Passkey Hardening**: Automatically blocks annoying Windows Passkey/Social-Login popups for a seamless entry.
- **Clean UI (Native Feel)**: Automatically hides web-specific clutter like "Explore Premium", "Install App", and "Upgrade" banners.
- **Lava Animation Taskbar**: A custom, Spotify-themed glassmorphism taskbar with dynamic blob animations.
